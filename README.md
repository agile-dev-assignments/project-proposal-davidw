### Project title
Never Late

### What and why?
This is a mobile app that is used for planning time and reminding you events you need to attend. Including events at home and events where you need to go to a specific location. The planner will send notifications every day and before the starting time to remind you of the events.

### For whom?
This software is for people who has a bit of trouble arriving on time and keep track of their plans and time.

### How?
The user can log in their account to input their events and get notifications and plans based on them. For events at home, they can input the time the events start and appoximate time it would take. For events where the user needs to arrive to a location, the user inputs the times and the location of the event to estimate how long it would take to get there. The software will send notifications every day and slightly before the event to remind the user. If there are potential time conflict, the software will warn the user. 

### Scope
The project shouldn't be very hard. In case it is too easy, it can add additional features.
