# Project Proposal

### Project title
Never Late

### What and why?
This is a mobile app that is used for planning time and reminding you events you need to attend. Including events at home and events where you need to go to a specific location. The planner will send notifications every day and before the starting time to remind you of the events.

### For whom?
This software is for people who has a bit of trouble arriving on time and keep track of their plans and time.

### How?
- The software has a login system with basic functions like signup, login, change password etc. 

- The user can input their events and get notifications and plans based on them. The user will input the time the events start and appoximate time it would take, and how important the event is. 

- For events where the user needs to arrive to a location, the user inputs additionally the location of the event so the software can estimate how long it would take to get there to get the time the user needs to leave. 

- The software will send notifications every day to remind the user to see the list of events for that day. Additionally send notification slightly before the event to remind the user to attend the event. 

- When the user open the notification of the day, the software will show the schedule of the day with the important events highlighted. 

- When the user open the notification before the event, he/she can choose to remind them again after a minute, or that they are starting to attend the event. Either way the software will ask again to make sure the user didn't treat it like an alarm at 8:00.

- If there are potential time conflict, the software will warn the user. 

### Scope
The project shouldn't be very hard. In case it is too easy, it can add additional features.
